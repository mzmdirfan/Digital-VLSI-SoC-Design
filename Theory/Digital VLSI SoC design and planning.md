-  The starting point of the flow involves writing a hardware description using languages like Verilog or VHDL.
-  The RTL (Register Transfer Level) code describes the functionality and behavior of the digital circuit without focusing on physical implementation details.

<details> <summary> Synthesis </summary> 
  
 ## Synthesis:
- Transform the RTL code into a gate-level netlist using standard cells from a technology library.
- Tool like Yosys Design Compiler map the design to a specific technology library (standard cells like NAND, NOR, flip-flops).

<details> <summary> Floorplanning </summary> 
  
## Floorplanning:
- Floorplanning determines the arrangement of major functional blocks (macros like memory or ALUs) and reserves space for components like I/O pads and power grids.
- Optimize chip area utilization.
- Minimize interconnect delays by placing related components close together.
- Ensure adequate space for routing and clock distribution.
- Outputs include a rough layout of the chip, including regions for standard cells and macro placement.
